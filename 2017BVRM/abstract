* who am I
* where I come from
* shaped by the people I've met
  * internship with Greg Wilson
  * I didn't know anything, and learned from him
  * importance of mentorship
  * first contributions to a FOSS - Markus
* I then continued my studies, and contributed to my second FOSS: OpenOffice
* passage through industry, and first introductions to the scientific python
  community:
  * I did the graphics design for Euroscipy, got free ride for the conference.
  * My company was big on sending people to FOSS conference: I went to
    EuroPython:
    * There was very very very few women there. Maybe between 5%?
  * I had this dual "general" and scientific python community aspect for a
    while.
* Got interested with machine learning and data science
  * I was handed the sklearn's manual
  * Went to a sprint. Contributed my first sklearn patch : the mini batch
    k-means
  * Became a core contributor of sklearn.
* Quit my job, and started a second masters in Machine Learning and Data
  Science, and started a PhD
  * Started contributing to matplotlib after finding a bug.
  * Scratch an itch kind of contributions.
  * went into a blooming interdisciplinary field
* Education
* Contributing to FOSS really helped me get on top of my field, and learn how
  to code fast and well.

  - Contributed to MarkUS
  - Contributed OpenOffice, now known as LibreOffice
2010: 
  - Graduated from Engineering school
  - Was asked to do the web design for Euroscipy 2010
  - Got a job in industry thanks to
    - My internship with Greg Wilson
    - Possibly my contribution to OpenOffice
    - Realistically, I knew nothing about what I was hired to do...
  - Went to Euroscipy 2010 and Europython 2010
    - The community was incredibly welcoming
  - My boss mentored me and taught me a lot of what I know
2011: 
  - Told to meet ``ogrisel''
  - Went to FOSDEM
    - met ``ogrisel''
  - Got involved in organizing PyconFR 2011
  - Was told that machine learning would help me do my job better.
  - Got handed the scikit-learn's documentation.
  - Did my first contribution to scikit-learn.
  - Got convinced by my brother (one of scikit-learn's lead) to do a masters
    in Maths and Machine learning
  - Applied for the MVA
  - Got in, but was told by the hiring committee that I would probably failed.
  - Quit my job
  - Went to RMLL:
    - Got 4 presentations accepted, one on sklearn
  - Moved by to Paris
  - Went to Euroscipy 2011
    - Met Fernando Perez & Stéfan van der Walt

2012:
  - Graduated from my master
    - yeaaaaaaaah
  - Did an internship in comp bio, with one of the teachers
  - Got a lot done during my master internship thanks to my good knowledge of
    sklearn.
  - Started a PhD in the same team.
  - Found a bug in Matplotlib.
  - Told it wasn't a bug, and wouldn't be fixed.
  - Got annoyed, and started to contribute to Matplotlib
    (that bug never got fixed…)

2013, 2014
  - worked a lot on my phd…
