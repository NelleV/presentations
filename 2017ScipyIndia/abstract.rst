A scientific approach to understanding open-source communities
==============================================================

Open-source software mostly rely on the hands and contributions of volunteers,
experts or not in software development. As such, building thriving well
organized communities is crucial for the survival of the software. Both
technical and social choices drive the successes of these projects.

I would like to explore in this presentation the lessons learned building
those communities, and from my work in collaboration with ethnographers to
better understand FOSS communities. What drives people to contribute their
time and effort to FOSS project? Why don't contributors write documentation?
What is the infrastructure used by FOSS projects and can we improve it?


Outline and main ideas
----------------------

- Everyone has their ideas on what makes FOSS projects successful, both
	technically and socially.
- Can we approach this question in a more scientific manner?

	- from collaboration with ethnographers;
	- from data-driven quantitative approachs;



Detailed Outline
----------------

* Title

* Where I come from

* How I started to do Scientific Python
	
	- My first project contributed web application in Ruby on Rails...
	- Then OpenOffice...
	- Then, scikit-learn:
		- No experience in scientific python
		- No experience in machine-learning.
		- I fell in the magic potion

* FOSS communities, how do they work

* A fascinating topic…

	- A lot of scientific python keynotes are about FOSS communities

* Why is a scientific approach necessary?

  - We all have strong opinions about what makes a community successful, but
    no real insight on what actually works.
  - That's not only a problem for FOSS communities, or even for software
    engineering.

  - Example:
    
    - Breast cancer and masectomies
    - Brain surgery
    - Does pair programming really make people more productive?
      - It does in some case, but not in other
    - TDD

* BIDS, a place for people like "us"

	- And ethnographers are also fascinated by "us".
	- BIDS, a unique opportunity to have people like "us" talk to scientist studying communities.

* Can we bridge our knowledge of the FOSS communities ?

	- can we use the ethnographer's knowledge of how communities work to our
		insights in managing and belonging to our communities? 
	- can we do this in a quantitative and data-driven manner? I am after all a
		"data scientist". 


* The ethnographer's approach

  - What is ethnography
    “Ethnography is an approach to understanding cultural life that is founded
    not just on witnessing but on participation, with the goal of understanding
    not simply what people are doing, but how they experience what they do.” 
    --Paul Dourish, Reading and Interpreting Ethnography 

  - ethnography methods

    Interviews (un/semi-structured)
    Focus groups
    Field observation
    Participant-observation
    Case studies
    Oral histories
    Archival research
    Surveys* 

  - Ethnography of Computation

  Using traditional ethnographic methods to study how people in particular
  cultural contexts relate to computation and/or relate to each other through
  computation.
  How do people design, develop, deploy, document, debate, maintain, manage,
  use, not use, learn, or teach computation and computational systems in their
  everyday life and work? 
  What are the different perspectives and attitudes people have towards
  computational systems, artifacts, and methods?

* What kind of questions can we ask?

  - Why do people contribute to FOSS? 
    - what are there motivations and incentives?
  - Does the infrastructure help? Does GitHub help? Does Travis help?
  - What are the tensions that emerge in the communities. 
  - Why do people write documentation?
